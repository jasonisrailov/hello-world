This is just a short and simple hello world respiratory.

Hello World!

My name is Jason Israilov. I am a senior in High School and I love to code. 
Not only do I have a passion for computer science, but I also like to play sports and hang out with friends.
Some of my favorite sports are lacrosse, biking, rock climbing, bowling, ping-pong and basketball.

My favorite foods are sandwiches, pastas, burgers, and calzones. 
My favorite fruits are strawberries and apples.

I am very excited to continue to learn to code. I believe that the best programming language to learn as a beginner is Python.

The the programming languages that will be booming in 2018 are Python, Kotlin, Go, and Swift.

I have created a simple personal website for anyone wanting to contact me: https://jasonisrailov.github.io.

I also contribute a lot to the NHacks Hackathon website: http://nhacks.org.
